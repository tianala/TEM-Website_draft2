                Decorative vases for your flowers can be expensive and fragile. Fortunately, making your own vases is easy! For one option, all you need are a pair of scissors and an empty plastic bottle. Cut the top off the bottle and make strips around the border. Then fold those strips into a decorative design. For another option, decorate the vase with paint and stickers. This is a great activity for kids. Making a vase out of used plastic bottles is a fun and environmentally-friendly activity that allows you to decorate your home with bouquets of beautiful flowers.

                            Find the spot near the top of the bottle where it starts to curve inward. Take a utility knife and pierce the plastic with the knife tip. Cut around the bottle until the top detaches.[9]

                        Pick a pattern that you'd like for the top of your vase. An easy choice is a series of semicircular lines for a rounded top. Take a permanent marker and draw a semicircle that touches the top edge of the bottle, about the size of a quarter. Repeat this shape along the whole edge until you work all the way around.[10]

                The best paints for painting on plastic are acrylic or spray paint. Choose one of these types and pick a color for your vase. If you want, you can also use multiple colors on the vase. Alternatively, leave some sections clear and paint in others for a nice effect. You have lots of options for painting your vase.[12]

            <p class="additional-paragraph5">Place rhinestones or stickers around the bottle for extra decoration. If you want more decoration, these are great options. Apply hot glue to rhinestones and stick them around the bottle. You can also use decorative stickers for a simpler approach.[13]
