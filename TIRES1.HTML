            <p class="additional-paragraph10">This can either be done by hand or by using a sewing machine. Sew the three pinned sides of the pillow case, making sure the seam is 1/4 to 1/2 inch away from the cut edge of the fabric.

                <li>The distance between the seam and the cut edge of the fabric will affect the tautness of the pillow and the amount of stuffing able to be placed inside. A larger seam allowance (1/2") means you will be able to place less stuffing inside of the pillow. The opposite is true for smaller seam allowances (1/4").</li>

                Stuff the pillow.</div>
            <p class="additional-paragraph13">Use the opening left in the case to insert the stuffing you have chosen for your pillow. Use more or less stuffing according to preference. To achieve even and leveled stuffing:
            </p>
            <ul class="paragraph-list13">
                <li>Pull apart and fluff softer stuffing materials such as cotton or down. You are ensuring softness while removing hard clumps.</li>
                <li>Begin stuffing with small portions into the corner of the pillow farthest from the opening. Be gentle, but firm. You may use your hand or a spoon or rod to help stuff the pillow.</li>
                <li>Stuff the following corners in the same fashion. Slowly work your way toward the pillow opening.</li>
                <li>Keep an eye on the outside of the pillow as you stuff. Irregularities or divots visible on the outside of the pillow should be addressed with the redistribution or addition of stuffing.</li>
                <li>Once the pillow is mostly stuffed, give it a gentle squeeze. If the pillow is too firm, remove stuffing to your liking. If too soft, add more stuffing.[7]</li>
                <li>Hard stuffing such as microbeads or seed should not be packed too tightly in the pillow. Fill the pillow 3/4 of the way full with harder stuffing and then test the firmness.</li>
                <li>Hard stuffing can also be mixed with other, softer stuffing to help balance firmness. Seed and flower petals, for example, can make for an aromatic and texturally pleasing combination.</li>
                <li>Sew over the seams of your pillow to create a tighter seam if you are unsatisfied with the level of stuffing possible in your pillow. A tighter seam will create a tighter, compact environment for the stuffing.</li>

If you are interested in retaining the ability to open the pillow, close the pillow by sewing a zipper into the opening. This will allow you to easily open the pillow to change the stuffing in the future.
