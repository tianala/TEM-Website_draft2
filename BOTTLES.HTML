            Decorative vases for your flowers can be expensive and fragile. Fortunately, making your own vases is easy! For one option, all you need are a pair of scissors and an empty plastic bottle. Cut the top off the bottle and make strips around the border. Then fold those strips into a decorative design. For another option, decorate the vase with paint and stickers. This is a great activity for kids. Making a vase out of used plastic bottles is a fun and environmentally-friendly activity that allows you to decorate your home with bouquets of beautiful flowers.
