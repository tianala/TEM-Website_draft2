                We all have old clothes that we don’t wear anymore. Rather than let them sit in the closet forever, how about repurposing them into some cute pillows? It’s a great way to recycle your clothes instead of throwing them out, and you can get creative with a variety of fabric options.

                            <li>Will the pillow be for decorative purposes? In this case, the size, shape and fabric are entirely up to your own liking. Decorative pillows are rarely sat upon, so comfort doesn't need to be a factor.</li>
                            <li>Will the pillow be used as a cushion? For example, will people be lying against the pillow on the couch, or will the pillow be used as a sleeping pillow? If so, size, shape, fabric and stuffing will all play an important part in the comfort level of the pillow.</li>
                            <li>Common throw pillow sizes are square in shape and range in size from 12"x12" to 24"x24".[1]</li>
                            <li>Common bed pillows sizes are more rectangular in shape and start at 20"x26".[2]</li>

                <ul class="paragraph-list3">
                    <li>Review your materials carefully. If you want to make a larger pillow but only have a small amount of the fabric needed, you may have to change your plan.</li>
                    <li>Choose clothing with softer fabrics such as satin, silk, cotton or flannel if you are making a pillow that demands comfort, such as a bed pillow.</li>
                    <li>Tougher fabrics, such as polyester or linen, are great to use as decorative pillows, as their sturdy composition helps the pillows maintain shape and last longer.</li>
                    <li>Tougher fabrics are also useful if you need to make a sturdy cushion for kids or pets.[3]</li>

                Choosing the right stuffing for your pillow goes hand in hand with the fabric selection to create the perfect pillow for your needs. Different stuffing lends itself well to different purposes.
            </p>
            <ul class="paragraph-list4">
                <li>Materials such as cotton, wool, and duck or goose down and feathers are among the softest types of pillow stuffing and are great for sleeping pillows. Take care when selecting; some stuffing, such as down, cannot be washed, as the feathers will not dry.</li>
                <li>Synthetic materials such as polyester, foam and microbeads tend to be cheaper than natural materials, and can range in their levels of firmness.</li>
                <li>Seeds and herbs like buckwheat, millet, flaxseed and lavender can also be used as pillow stuffing if you're making a decorative pillow. Note that this stuffing is harder than other types of stuffing and often a bit noisy. However, certain seeds and herbs give off a pleasant aroma, which can help enhance a decorative pillow’s purpose.[4]</li>

                <li>If your article of clothing is identical on both its front and back side, and you are confident in your cutting ability, you can trace just one measurement with chalk and use it to cut both pieces of fabric at once.</li>

                Sew the fabric together.</div>
            <p class="additional-paragraph10">This can either be done by hand or by using a sewing machine. Sew the three pinned sides of the pillow case, making sure the seam is 1/4 to 1/2 inch away from the cut edge of the fabric.

            <ul class="paragraph-list10">
                <li>Consider using a slip stitch method to hide the threading on the pillow, if desired.</li>
                <li>The distance between the seam and the cut edge of the fabric will affect the tautness of the pillow and the amount of stuffing able to be placed inside. A larger seam allowance (1/2") means you will be able to place less stuffing inside of the pillow. The opposite is true for smaller seam allowances (1/4").</li>
               <li>Partially sew the fourth side of the pillow. Leave enough space on the fourth side so that you can easily fit your hand into the pillow case.</li>

            </p>
            <ul class="paragraph-list13">
                <li>Pull apart and fluff softer stuffing materials such as cotton or down. You are ensuring softness while removing hard clumps.</li>
                <li>Begin stuffing with small portions into the corner of the pillow farthest from the opening. Be gentle, but firm. You may use your hand or a spoon or rod to help stuff the pillow.</li>
                <li>Stuff the following corners in the same fashion. Slowly work your way toward the pillow opening.</li>
                <li>Keep an eye on the outside of the pillow as you stuff. Irregularities or divots visible on the outside of the pillow should be addressed with the redistribution or addition of stuffing.</li>
                <li>Once the pillow is mostly stuffed, give it a gentle squeeze. If the pillow is too firm, remove stuffing to your liking. If too soft, add more stuffing.[7]</li>
                <li>Hard stuffing such as microbeads or seed should not be packed too tightly in the pillow. Fill the pillow 3/4 of the way full with harder stuffing and then test the firmness.</li>
                <li>Hard stuffing can also be mixed with other, softer stuffing to help balance firmness. Seed and flower petals, for example, can make for an aromatic and texturally pleasing combination.</li>
                <li>Sew over the seams of your pillow to create a tighter seam if you are unsatisfied with the level of stuffing possible in your pillow. A tighter seam will create a tighter, compact environment for the stuffing.</li>
